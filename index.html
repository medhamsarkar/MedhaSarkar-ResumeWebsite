        <div class="subheading mb-5">EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year Economics student studying at University of California, Riverside. I am planning to graduate with a major in Economics and a minor in Computer Science. My interests include leadership, marketing, investing, coding, and business. I am currently searching for an internship in any of the following concentrations or industries: business, marketing, investing, coding, investment banking, social media management, social media intern. I am willing to work virtually for remote internships from anywhere around the world and am situated in Orange County, California for in-person internship positions.<br><br>

        My most recent employment was at Nordstrom, where I worked as a retail associate for entry level retail experience. I worked closely with my managers to create a beneficial environment for those shopping at Nordstrom during the aftermath of the pandemic and helped prepare and work through a large influx of orders during one of their two biggest sales of the year. As a first year, I do not have extensive internship experience, but have worked many positions in technology and marketing in nonprofits. For example, I held a position as Director of Marketing at Change the Cycle where I created a marketing campaign in the form of a color scheme for the Instagram and website, designed the website, created aesthetic blog posts for the website, and advertised for many events. Additionally, I have leadership experience working in clubs as Vice President of South Asian Student Association, Secretary of Child Rights and You, and Secretary/Treasurer of Girls Empowerment, where I worked through issues such as low attendance and kept track of many club members all while advertising for various club events. I intend to continue to make a social impact at University of California, Riverside by joining clubs which follow my passions. I am a member of three clubs as of now, including but not limited to Future Business Leaders of America - Phi Beta Lambda (PBL-FBLA), South Asian Federation (SAF), and School on Wheels (SOW).<br><br>

        Some of my hobbies include reading (both fiction and nonfiction), writing, and music (playing guitar, piano, and songwriting). I am pursing my hobbies at college, on top of my professional and academic coursework and extracurriculars, by joining an a capella club specifically for South Asians, introducing me to a welcoming community of other South Asian people who share my passion for singing and music. After already being a part of an a capella group in high school, I am easily situated into this group. I also enjoy volunteering, which I have been doing since seventh grade through a community organization called Youth Action Team and continue to pursue in both clubs and organizations outside of school, such as School on Wheels tutoring. Through the COVID-19 pandemic, I continued to pursue this passion through organizations and clubs such as Hearts to Heroes where I made care packages, letters, and face shields to be donated to healthcare workers and others who need but do not have access to these. While I joined School on Wheels to be able to help students who need extra help but cannot get it because of their home situation, I also joined a club called Never Ending Cycle that helps mainly homeless women get more access to period products.
